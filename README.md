View the live site on [heroku](https://tech-scraper.herokuapp.com/).

### User Story
Scrape new articles from [Tech Crunch](https://techcrunch.com/) straight from the navbar, or select Articles and scroll down to view a compilation of the latest scraped news. Users can immediately read a short synopsis on each article or follow a link to read the full article directly at Tech Crunch. Clicking on the chat icon in the bottom right of each article's display will reveal the back side of the card, which shows readers' comments and lets new users add their own thoughts! 

Don't worry, if you don't like any of the comments, you're granted omnipotent access to a handy delete button. As soon as you click it, those pesky notes disappear forever. Optionally, the user can click on the expand button from the back side of the card and the article's info opens in a separate modal for more spacious viewing.
